doc.0.sent.0|We describe the first case of hyperacute reversible encephalopathy following COVID-19 vaccination.|34284342
doc.0.sent.1|A patient presented with acute onset encephalopathy, mainly characterized by agitation and confusion, rapidly responsive to high dosage steroid therapy and complete remission within 3 days from onset.|34284342
doc.0.sent.2|The clinical manifestation was related with systemic and CSF cytokine hyperproduction, responsive to steroid therapy.|34284342
doc.0.sent.3|Although the occurrence of encephalopathy after vaccination may be just a casual temporal association, we speculate that the cytokine-storm could be the result of an excessive innate immune response against the vaccine, in a predisposed patient susceptible to autoimmunity.|34284342
doc.1.sent.0|COVID-19 pandemic has forced important changes in health care worldwide.|34284323
doc.1.sent.1|Stroke care networks have been affected, especially during peak periods.|34284323
doc.1.sent.2|We assessed the impact of the pandemic and lockdowns in stroke admissions and care in Latin America.|34284323
doc.1.sent.3|A multinational study (7 countries, 18 centers) of patients admitted during the pandemic outbreak (March-June 2020).|34284323
doc.1.sent.5|Numbers of cases, stroke etiology and severity, acute care and hospitalization outcomes were assessed.|34284323
doc.1.sent.6|Most countries reported mild decreases in stroke admissions compared to the same period of 2019 (1187 vs. 1166, p = 0.03).|34284323
doc.1.sent.7|Among stroke subtypes, there was a reduction in ischemic strokes (IS) admissions (78.3% vs. 73.9%, p = 0.01) compared with 2019, especially in IS with NIHSS 0-5 (50.1% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.03).|34284323
doc.1.sent.8|A substantial increase in the proportion of stroke admissions beyond 48 h from symptoms onset was observed (13.8% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001).|34284323
doc.1.sent.9|Nevertheless, no differences in total reperfusion treatment rates were observed, with similar door-to-needle, door-to-CT, and door-to-groin times in both periods.|34284323
doc.1.sent.10|Other stroke outcomes, as all-type mortality during hospitalization (4.9% vs. 9.7%, p < 0.001), length of stay (IQR 1-5 days vs. 0-9 days, p < 0.001), and likelihood to be discharged home (91.6% vs. 83.0%, p < 0.001), were compromised during COVID-19 lockdown period.|34284323
doc.1.sent.11|In this Latin America survey, there was a mild decrease in admissions of IS during the COVID-19 lockdown period, with a significant delay in time to consultations and worse hospitalization outcomes.|34284323
doc.2.sent.0|Current literature has focused on testing saliva in symptomatic patients, and little information is available regarding saliva performance in asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.|34284319
doc.2.sent.1|We compared paired saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected from 33 symptomatic and 12 asymptomatic known SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.|34284319
doc.2.sent.2|Saliva had an overall sensitivity of 59%, a specificity of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 98%.|34284319
doc.2.sent.3|Saliva demonstrated higher sensitivity in symptomatic (80%) vs. asymptomatic individuals (36%) (P = 0.006), and in high-risk (symptomatic, febrile and/or with comorbidities) (82%) vs. low-risk (asymptomatic, afebrile, and no comorbidities) (22%) patients (P = 0.0002).|34284319
doc.2.sent.4|Cycle threshold (Ct) values in NPS specimens were higher in saliva-negative vs. saliva-positive cases (P = 0.02 and <0.001).|34284319
doc.2.sent.5|Overall, these findings show that despite saliva's low sensitivity in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, it can detect infections with lower Ct values and a potentially higher chance of viral transmission.|34284319
doc.2.sent.6|Additional studies are warranted to fully evaluate saliva as a screening test for coronavirus disease-2019.|34284319
doc.3.sent.0|We aimed to explore the risk profiles attributable to psychosocial and behavioural problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.|34284318
doc.3.sent.1|To this end, we created a risk-prediction nomogram model.|34284318
doc.3.sent.2|A national multicentre study was conducted through an online questionnaire involving 12,186 children (6-11 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old).|34284318
doc.3.sent.3|Respondents' psychosocial and behavioural functioning were assessed using the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL).|34284318
doc.3.sent.4|Data were analysed using STATA software and R-language.|34284318
doc.3.sent.5|The positive detection rate of psychological problems within Wuhan was greater than that outside Wuhan for schizoid (P = 0.005), and depression (P = 0.030) in children, and for somatic complaints (P = 0.048), immaturity (P = 0.023), and delinquent behaviour (P = 0.046) in adolescents.|34284318
doc.3.sent.6|After graded multivariable adjustment, seven factors associated with psychological problems in children and adolescents outside Wuhan were parent-child conflict (odds ratio (OR): 4.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.27-5.72), sleep problems (OR: 4.05, 95% CI: 3.77-4.36), online study time (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.37-0.47), physical activity time (OR: 0.510, 95% CI: 0.44-0.59), number of close friends (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.6), time spent playing videogames (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.90-2.69) and eating disorders (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 2.35-3.11) (all P < 0.001).|34284318
doc.3.sent.7|Contrastingly, within Wuhan, only the first four factors, namely, parent-child conflict (5.95, 2.82-12.57), sleep problems (4.47, 3.06-6.54), online study time (0.37, 0.22-0.64), and physical activity time (0.42, 0.22-0.80) were identified (all P < 0.01).|34284318
doc.3.sent.8|Accordingly, nomogram models were created with significant attributes and had decent prediction performance with C-indexes over 80%.|34284318
doc.3.sent.9|A cross-sectional study and self-reported measures.|34284318
doc.3.sent.10|Besides the four significant risk factors within and outside Wuhan, the three additional factors outside Wuhan deserve special attention.|34284318
doc.3.sent.11|The prediction nomogram models constructed in this study have important clinical and public health implications for psychosocial and behavioural assessment.|34284318
doc.4.sent.0|We examined changes in psychological outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic (ie psychological stress, perceived control, and perceived ability to cope) and changes in sleep health in the American Indian Blackfeet community over 4 months (August 24, 2020-November 30, 2020).|34284315
doc.4.sent.1|American Indian adults residing on the Blackfeet reservation (n = 167) completed measures of perceived control over contracting COVID-19, perceived ability to cope with pandemic stressors, psychological stress linked to the pandemic, and a measure of sleep health each month.|34284315
doc.4.sent.2|Linear-effects mixed models were used to examine changes in our outcomes.|34284315
doc.4.sent.3|Community members who reported more control over contracting the virus had better sleep health relative to those who reported less control (B = 0.72, SE = 0.29, p = 0.015).|34284315
doc.4.sent.4|Further, during months when individuals felt they had more control over contracting the virus compared to their average perceived control levels, they had better sleep health relative to their own average (B = 1.06, SE = 0.13, p < 0.001).|34284315
doc.4.sent.5|Average sleep health was the lowest in October, 2020, the month during which COVID-19 incidence was at its highest on the reservation.|34284315
doc.4.sent.6|Declines in sleep health linked to low levels of control over contracting COVID-19 may exacerbate high incidence of chronic mental and physical health conditions in tribal communities.|34284315
doc.4.sent.7|Interventions which highlight strategies known to reduce risk of contracting the virus, may increase perceived control and sleep health, and thus may improve downstream health outcomes for this at-risk population.|34284315
doc.5.sent.0|The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable behavioral health implications globally.|34284311
doc.5.sent.1|One subgroup that may be of particular concern is U.S. veterans, who are susceptible to mental health and substance use concerns.|34284311
doc.5.sent.2|The current study aimed to investigate changes in alcohol use and binge drinking before and during the first year of the pandemic among U.S. veterans, and how pre-pandemic mental health disorders, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and COVID-19-related factors like loneliness, negative reactions to COVID-19, and economic hardship influenced alcohol use trends.|34284311
doc.5.sent.3|1230 veterans were recruited in February 2020 as part of a larger survey study on veteran health behaviors.|34284311
doc.5.sent.4|Veterans were asked to complete follow-up assessments throughout the pandemic at 6, 9, and 12- months.|34284311
doc.5.sent.5|Overall, veterans reported a significant decrease in alcohol use (IRR = 0.98) and binge drinking (IRR = 0.11) However, women, racial/ethnic minority veterans, and those with pre-existing PTSD exhibited smaller decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking and overall higher rates of use compared to men, White veterans, and those without PTSD.|34284311
doc.5.sent.6|Both economic hardship and negative reactions to COVID-19 were associated with greater alcohol and binge drinking whereas loneliness showed a negative association with alcohol use and binge drinking.|34284311
doc.5.sent.7|Veterans reported decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking throughout the pandemic, with heterogeneity in these outcomes noted for higher risk groups.|34284311
doc.5.sent.8|Special research and clinical attention should be given to the behavioral health care needs of veterans in the post-pandemic period.|34284311
doc.6.sent.0|Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe; and surprisingly, no potentially protective or therapeutic antiviral molecules are available to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.|34284268
doc.6.sent.1|However, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) have been shown to exert protective effects due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties.|34284268
doc.6.sent.2|Therefore, it is hypothesized that supplementation with Zn and Cu alone or as an adjuvant may be beneficial with promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile to mitigate symptoms, as well as halt progression of the severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.|34284268
doc.6.sent.3|The objective of this review is to discuss the proposed underlying molecular mechanisms and their implications for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to Zn and Cu administration.|34284268
doc.6.sent.4|Several clinical trials have also included the use of Zn as an adjuvant therapy with dietary regimens/antiviral drugs against COVID-19 infection.|34284268
doc.6.sent.5|Overall, this review summarizes that nutritional intervention with Zn and Cu may offer an alternative treatment strategy by eliciting their virucidal effects through several fundamental molecular cascades, such as, modulation of immune responses, redox signaling, autophagy, and obstruction of viral entry and genome replication during SARS-CoV-2 infection.|34284268
doc.7.sent.0|Most countries are dependent on nonpharmaceutical public health interventions such as social distancing, contact tracing, and case isolation to mitigate COVID-19 spread until medicines or vaccines widely available.|34284227
doc.7.sent.1|Minimal research has been performed on the independent and combined impact of each of these interventions based on empirical case data.|34284227
doc.7.sent.2|We obtained data from all confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 7th to February 22nd 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China, to fit an age-stratified compartmental model using human contact information before and during the outbreak.|34284227
doc.7.sent.3|The effectiveness of social distancing, contact tracing, and case isolation was studied and compared in simulation.|34284227
doc.7.sent.4|We also simulated a two-phase reopening scenario to assess whether various strategies combining nonpharmaceutical interventions are likely to achieve population-level control of a second-wave epidemic.|34284227
doc.7.sent.5|Our study sample included 1,218 symptomatic cases with COVID-19, of which 664 had no inter-province travel history.|34284227
doc.7.sent.6|Results suggest that 36.5 % (95 % CI, 12.8-57.1) of contacts were quarantined, and approximately five days (95 % CI, 2.2-11.0) were needed to detect and isolate a case.|34284227
doc.7.sent.7|As contact networks would increase after societal and economic reopening, avoiding a second wave without strengthening nonpharmaceutical interventions compared to the first wave it would be exceedingly difficult.|34284227
doc.7.sent.8|Continuous attention and further improvement of nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed in second-wave prevention.|34284227
doc.8.sent.0|Symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection has been reported in vaccination.|34284226
doc.8.sent.1|In the current article, we try to elucidate various causes behind COVID-19 infection and mortality following COVID-19 vaccination and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat.|34284226
doc.8.sent.2|We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Vaccines', 'Mortality', 'deaths', 'infections', and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate in from January to May 2021.|34284226
doc.8.sent.3|Epidemiology, risk factors, Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination were assessed.|34284226
doc.8.sent.4|A number of factors have been associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection reported after vaccination.|34284226
doc.8.sent.5|A high viral load, comorbidities, mutant strains, Variants of Concern (VOC) leading to Vaccine escape and casual attitude towards COVID Appropriate Behaviors appear to be the most important factors for infection and deaths after COVID-19 vaccination.|34284226
doc.8.sent.6|COVID-19 Infection and mortality after COVID-19 vaccination are of great concern.|34284226
doc.8.sent.7|Application of COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) before and after vaccination is essential for the population.|34284226
doc.8.sent.8|Effective Vaccines against mutant strains and enhanced vaccination drive are key strategies to avoid this quintessential threat.|34284226
doc.8.sent.9|Early medical intervention in high-risk groups can prevent overall mortality.|34284226
doc.9.sent.0|Migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable population groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.|34284218
doc.9.sent.1|This study investigated knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers (IMWs) in Macao (SAR), Hong Kong (SAR), and Taiwan.|34284218
doc.9.sent.3|Data were collected through an online survey in February and March 2020 to gain information on (1) participants' sociodemographic characteristics, (2) experience and awareness regarding COVID-19 information, and (3) knowledge and understanding of COVID-19.|34284218
doc.9.sent.4|A series of Chi-squared, t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted.|34284218
doc.9.sent.6|Knowledge of COVID-19 was obtained from multiple sources, including a large proportion from online social media.|34284218
doc.9.sent.7|However, participants who obtained information from their employer, local social networks, and migrant organisations answered a greater number of questions correctly.|34284218
doc.9.sent.8|One-third of participants reported receiving hoax, fake news, and incorrect information and obtained information from unverified sources.|34284218
doc.9.sent.9|Participants were most interested in information about how to cure COVID-19, and 57.8% knew that no specific drug or vaccine was currently available.|34284218
doc.9.sent.10|Almost all participants correctly identified fever and wearing a facemask as the main COVID-19 symptom and prevention strategy, respectively.|34284218
doc.9.sent.11|Participants with senior high school or higher education and who worked as domestic or care workers had a greater knowledge of COVID-19 than their counterparts.|34284218
doc.9.sent.12|Public health communication strategies using multiple channels, including employers and community organisations, would help to minimise COVID-19 knowledge gaps.|34284218
doc.9.sent.13|In addition, it is recommended that digital literacy content is added to public health campaigns.|34284218
doc.10.sent.0|Natural Killer (NK) cells are considered the first line of defense against viral infections and tumors.|34284214
doc.10.sent.1|Several factors affect NK cytotoxic activity rendering it dysfunctional and thereby impeding the ability to scavenge abnormal cells as a part of immune escaping mechanisms induced by different types of cancers.|34284214
doc.10.sent.2|NK cells play a crucial role augmenting the activity of various types of anticancer mAb since dysfunctional NK cells are the main reason for the low response to these therapies.|34284214
doc.10.sent.3|To this light, we examined the phenotypic characters of the circulating NK cells isolated from HCC patients compared to healthy controls.|34284214
doc.10.sent.4|Then, dysfunctional NK cells, from HCC patients, were reactivated with cytokines cocktail and their cytotoxic activity with the anti-EGFR mAb "cetuximab" was investigated.|34284214
doc.10.sent.5|This showed a downregulation of patients NK cells activating receptors (NKP30, NKP46, NKG2D and CD16) as well as CD56 and up-regulation of NKG2A inhibitory receptor.|34284214
doc.11.sent.0|This study investigates changes in air quality conditions during the restricted COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020 across 21 metropolitan areas in the Middle East and how these relate to surface urban heat island (SUHI) characteristics.|34284210

doc.12.sent.0|The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted surgical practice.|34284156
doc.12.sent.1|The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the pandemic on neurosurgical practice and the safety of the resumption of elective procedures through implementing screening protocols in a high-volume academic public center in Iran as one of the countries severely affected by the pandemic.|34284156
doc.12.sent.2|This unmatched case-control study compared two populations of patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures between June 1, 2019- September 1, 2019, and the same period in 2020.|34284156
doc.12.sent.3|In the prospective part of the study, patients who underwent elective procedures were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection postoperatively to evaluate the viability of our screening protocol.|34284156
doc.12.sent.4|Elective and emergency procedures showed significant reduction (59.4%, n=168 vs 71.3%, n=380) and increase (28.7%, n=153 vs 40.6%, n=115) in their percentages during the pandemic period, respectively (p=0.003).|34284156
doc.12.sent.5|The proportional distribution of neurosurgical categories remained unchanged during the pandemic period.|34284156
doc.12.sent.6|Poisson regression showed that the reduction in total daily admissions and some categories, including spine, trauma, oncology, and infection were significantly correlated with the pandemic period.|34284156
doc.12.sent.7|Among patients who underwent elective procedures, 0 (0.0%) and 26 (16.25%) had positive test results on day-30 and 60 postoperatively, respectively.|34284156
doc.12.sent.8|Overall mortality rates were comparable between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, yet patients with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection showed substantially higher mortality rates (65%).|34284156
doc.12.sent.9|By implementing safety and screening protocols with proper resource allocation, we can maintain the emergency care capacity while minimizing the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, complications, and mortality among neurosurgical patients during the pandemic period.|34284156
doc.12.sent.10|Similarly, for elective procedures, according to available resources, we can allocate hospital beds for patients with a higher risk of delayed hospitalization and reassure those who are concerned about the risk of hospital-acquired infection.|34284156
doc.13.sent.0|Diabetes is a known risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).|34284145
