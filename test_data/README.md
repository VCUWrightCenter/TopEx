# Test Dataset
All data in `/test_data` were taken from *Event-focused Emotion Corpora for German and English*. This dataset was created by Enrica Troiano, Sebastian Padó, and Roman Klinger at the Universität Stuttgart. It contains sentences which are classified as expressing one or more of seven emotions: guilt, anger, sadness, joy, fear, disgust, and/or shame. In `test_data`, we only use sentences labelled as joy, sadness, guilt, or shame and we use only a subset of the entire dataset. The processing script can be found at [create_test_data.ipynb](https://github.com/cctrbic/medtop/tree/master/test_data/create_test_data.ipynb).
