I felt guilt by not letting my sister help me sort out my bedroom, after she offered. I felt joy dancing down Gloucester Place in London with the man I loved. I felt guilt for denying to offer my kids what they demanded of me. I felt shame giving a cheque to the managing agent which did not cover all I owed. I felt joy lying on a yacht sweeping though the waves off Southern Brazil with a cold beer in my hand. I felt joy of cycling to the local nature reserve for a photo and getting perfect weather conditions for it when I arrived there. I felt guilt on an occasion when I took the name of Jesus Christ in vain in an attempt to impress the ladies that I was a big shot. I felt guilt one Christmas as one of our patients lives alone and would be spending Christmas by herself. I felt guilt one night when I was younger, I went out for a night drinking with a friend and I ended up dancing and kissing a girl in a club, despite the fact I already had a girlfriend, and I felt so much guilt the next couple of days that I broke up with my girlfriend the next time we spoke. I felt joy reading about the life of the Kardashians. I felt shame reading about the suffering of slaves in the middle passage when I read about it at university. I felt joy riffing out a song with the man I loved outside a pub in Chelsea. I felt guilt snogging a friend as I really did like his girlfriend. I felt guilt that I failed to pay back a loan from my parents, preferring to assume it had been forgotten about rather than reminded them of the subject when the opportunity arose. I felt guilt that I had promised to make a charitable donation this Christmas instead of buying a particular present for somebody, and never actually got around to it. I felt guilt that I lied about consuming the last of the milk this morning, letting my son take the blame from his mother. I felt guilt that I lied about my employment experience on a job application letter. I felt guilt that I moan about a life that is essentially privileged and comfortable, when there is real poverty in the world, even on the streets of my city. I felt guilt that I moved away to another country from my family as I met my partner. I felt joy that I received a Valentines Day card, and happened to recognise the handwriting as being from a girl I had a huge crush on.
