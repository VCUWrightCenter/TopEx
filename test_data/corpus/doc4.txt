I felt guilt when I called in sick for work one day when I wasn’t really sick. I felt sadness when I came across a dead cat in bits on the motorway, when I was driving earlier. I felt joy when I came home from hospital and was greeted by my beautiful dog who I had missed dearly. I felt shame when I cheated in an exam and I was caught. I felt joy when I completed a very long mountain trek for charity, and felt utter joy when I finished. I felt joy when I completed my first half marathon.

I felt guilt when I did not get round to doing the minutes of a meeting for almost three weeks. I felt sadness when I did not have the money for tickets to go and see my parents more often. I felt guilt when I did not volunteer to drive my parents back from London, when they said mum did not want dad to drive in the dark. I felt sadness when I didn't hear from an old friend that I messaged to wish a Happy Christmas. I felt shame when I didn’t do as well in my exams as I should have. I felt guilt when I didn’t take my cat to the vets for a while and she got ill. I felt sadness when I discovered I have a health problem that although not too serious will limit my life a little and signifies I am getting old. I felt shame when I drank too much and fell asleep.
